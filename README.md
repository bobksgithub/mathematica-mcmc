Mathematica Markov Chain Monte Carlo
====================================
Mathematica package containing a general-purpose [Markov chain Monte Carlo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) routine I wrote. Includes various examples and documentation.

### Features:

 * Convenience wrapper for fitting models to arbitrary-dimensional data with Gaussian errors
 * Handles both real-valued and discrete-valued model parameters
 * Uses Metropolis algorithm with decaying exponential proposal distribution
 * Progress monitor; support for auto save/resume


### Files:

 * `mcmc.m`: Package file
 * `mcmc_demonst.nb`: Demonstrations and documentation
